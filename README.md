### Acceptance Criteria
We have listed the acceptance criteria in two formats to help with learning. 

------- as given when then -----

1. GIVEN a user wants a search for a movie
   WHEN they specify the search criteria and age of the viewer
   THEN the user is shown the list of movies matching the criteria

2. GIVEN a user with a list of favourite movies
   WHEN they choose the option to see the list of their favourites
   THEN the user is shown the list 

3. GIVEN a user wants to add a movie to their favourites
   WHEN they select a movie 
   THEN the movie is added to the list of favourites for the user.
 
4. GIVEN a user wants to remove a movie from their favourites
   WHEN they select a movie
   THEN that movie is removed from the list of favourites for the user.

---- As a feature list---
1. User can search for movies for the any of the following combination of criteria:

### ðŸ“˜ Design:
We created an initial UML diagram to start off.
![MovieAPI_ClassDiagram](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79167426/169909169-2c38c37d-5304-4e89-8346-02ad18ecd1a8.png)

Our latest design is [here](https://github.com/sabomagicfeet/movie-api/blob/main/MovieAPI_ClassDiagram.png).

### ðŸ“˜ Implementation:
1. *Created spring boot application and added code for API endpoints with the appropriate HTTP verbs.*
2. *Addition of unit tests using Mockito.*
3. *Handled proper error and exception.*
4. *Tested API endpoints using Postman application.*
5. *Included an /info endpoint to give the user information on how the application works and a /health endpoint to give the health of the application (using the Java actuator dependency).*

### ðŸ“˜ Database:
The application uses a database in MySQL called 'movieapidb' to store user favorites.

### ðŸ“˜ Tools used:
1. Created Trello board to organise our tasks.
2. Organised a daily stand up time through Zoom calls.
3. Google JamBoard to picture out our ideas.
4. Used Swagger to create auto-generated documentation for APIs.


### ðŸ“˜ Extension Ideas:
Implement search by other criteria (by genre/actor).

To Use the Twilio API (https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms) to send a text to the user with the returned
information.

To deploy your API onto a cloud service, such as AWS using Docker.
